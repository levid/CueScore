Watch CoffeeScript Files and compile them to the js folder:

Run from app directory: cd app

coffee -c -o ../Resources/js/cuescore --watch cuescore

In another terminal window run to watch for spec file changes:

coffee -c -o ../spec/javascripts/libs --watch spec

----------------------------------
Use Maven to run Jasmine tests and code coverage
----------------------------------

from root project dir:

mvn archetype:generate -DarchetypeRepository=http://searls-maven-repository.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/snapshots -DarchetypeGroupId=com.github.searls -DarchetypeArtifactId=jasmine-archetype -DarchetypeVersion=1.2.0.0-SNAPSHOT -DgroupId=com.acme -DartifactId=my-jasmine-project -Dversion=0.0.1-SNAPSHOT
mvn jasmine:bdd

go to: http://localhost:8234 to see test results

To generate code coverage run:

mvn verify

*** TO make changes edit the pom.xml file in the root project dir.

If you don't want to use maven then just run these commands from project root dir:

gem install jasmine
rake jasmine

Go to: http://localhost:8888 to see test results
